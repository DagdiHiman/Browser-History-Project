# Browser-History-Project

The project titled “Implementation of Browser History using Data Structures” is basically an application that shows us how a browser stores and displays the history of website we have visited in it. This is implemented using doubly linked list. The browser history is stored in a form of a table which shows the websites URL and at what time we visited the URL and a delete button for deleting the entries from the history list. On clicking the website from the history list, the specific URL is opened in a new tab. For the GUI (Graphical User Interface) we have used HTML and CSS. And the main programming part is done using JavaScript.
The Project has three main modules:
i) Add – Here we enter the URL of the website to be visited.
ii) Delete – Deletes the entries from the History list.
iii) Display – Displays the History
